# Sunbeam extension template

This is a template to use to extend the [Sunbeam pipeline](https://github.com/sunbeam-labs/sunbeam). There are three major parts to a Sunbeam extension: 

 - `requirements.txt` specifies the extension's dependencies
 - `config.yml` contains configuration options that can be specified by the user when running an extension
 - `sbx_template.rules` contains the rules (logic/commands run) of the extension
